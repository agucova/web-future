# What I'm currently up to

**Last updated:** November 2025

## What is this page?
This page is a list of the things I'm currently doing, following the format laid out by the [/now](https://nownownow.com/about) movement.

This page has a dual purpose:
- It helps you know what I'm up to (if you're so inclined)
- It helps me be aware of all the stuff I'm doing 😶‍🌫️

## 🎯 Building Kairos

I'm Co-Director of [Kairos](https://kairos-project.org/), an AI safety fieldbuilding organization that's focused on supporting talent to work on risks from advanced AI. I've been doing this for a year and a half, and I think we've gotten very good at it.

We're currently:
- **Running [SPAR Fall 2025](https://sparai.org):** A part-time, remote research program hosting 86 projects pairing 314 mentees with 78 mentors over 3 months. As of recently, we became the biggest AI safety research program in the world!
- **Running [Pathfinder Fall 2025](https://pathfinder.kairos-project.org):** A program supporting 65 AI safety university group organizers with ~30 mentors
- **Scoping out new projects:** Evaluating new projects that Kairos could take on

## 🏛️ Organizing Fhe Field Work Forum

I'm helping organize the [Field Work Forum](https://fieldworkforum.org/) in SF, February 12–13, 2026. It's a cross-disciplinary workshop on building scientific research fields, bringing together people working on fieldbuilding across different domains.

## 📚 Still studying

I'm wrapping up my engineering degree at UC Chile, currently taking some of my final classes. Balancing coursework with running Kairos has been an... interesting challenge.
