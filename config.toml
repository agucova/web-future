I'm a generalist and [open sourcerer](https://github.com/agucova) that does a bit of everything, but perhaps nothing particularly well. I'm currently a Software Engineer in the [Worldview Investigations Team](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/qi3MEEmScmK87sfBZ/worldview-investigations-team-an-overview) at [Rethink Priorities](https://rethinkpriorities.org/), as well as an undergrad majoring in Computer Science Engineering üë®‚Äçüíª at [UC Chile](https://www.uc.cl/en).

I'm very passionate about computer science, cybersecurity and using tech for social impact. Most of my work is interdisciplinary, spanning everything from edtech to metascience, and I've also been involved in public policy, campaigning and activism.

Lately, I've started to work under the umbrella of the [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) community, and I'm pivoting my career towards working in AI Safety. As part of this pivot, I'm helping start an [AI Safety Initiative](https://aisuc.dev) at UC Chile.

‚ÑπÔ∏è I hold drop-in hours each saturday to talk about Effective Altruism, AI Safety and open source. Feel free to [pass by](https://calendly.com/agucova/drop-in-hours).
