I'm an engineering student and [open sourcerer](https://github.com/agucova) that does a bit of everything, none specially well. I'm from Chile  🇨🇱 and I'm currently majoring in Computing Engineering 👨‍💻 at [UC Chile](https://www.uc.cl/en).

I program mostly in Python and Julia, but I'm constantly learning and toying with new languages, currently Rust. I'm strongly interested in interdisciplinary scientific work, spanning everything from biomedical engineering to [metascience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metascience). 

I've been an organizer of March for Science Chile since 2017, and I currently volunteer as a back-end and infrastructure engineer at [América Transparente](https://americatransparente.org/), an NGO working on enabling government transparency throughout Latin America.

💬 Feel free to contact me if you're looking to collaborate on something!

My pronouns are he/him.
