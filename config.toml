I'm a student and open sourcerer that does a bit of everything, none specially well. I'm from Chile (chile) and I'm currently studying engineering at the Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile.

I program in C and Python but I'm constantly learning and toying with new languages, currently Nim . My main interest is biomedical engineering, but I'm also interested in Computer Science (go CS50x!), Quantified Self and Meta-Science, along with a bunch of other things. I'm a yearly organizer of March for Science Chile.

ðŸ’¬ Feel free to contact me if you're looking to collaborate on something!

My pronouns are he/him.
