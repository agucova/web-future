I'm an engineering student and [open sourcerer](https://github.com/agucova) that does a bit of everything, but nothing specially well. I'm currently an undergraduate majoring in Computer Science Engineering üë®‚Äçüíª at [UC Chile](https://www.uc.cl/en).

I'm very passionate about computer science, cybersecurity and using tech for social impact. Most of my work is interdisciplinary, spanning everything from edtech to metascience, and I've also been involved in public policy, campaigning and consultancy. Lately, I've started to work under the umbrella of the [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) community.

I'm also the Digital Platforms Lead at [Am√©rica Transparente](https://americatransparente.org/), an NGO working on enabling government transparency throughout Latin America by building open source tools for journalists. I've also been an organizer of [March for Science](https://marchforscience.org/) Chile since 2017, working to push for better scientific policy in Chile.

Along with some friends, I co-founded [Open Source UC](https://osuc.dev/), an organization that brings together students and professors to build awesome open source projects.

üí¨ Feel free to contact me if you're looking to collaborate on something!

My pronouns are he/him.
