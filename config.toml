I'm an engineering student and [open sourcerer](https://github.com/agucova) that does a bit of everything, nothing specially well. I'm from Chile  🇨🇱 and I'm currently an undergraduate majoring in Computer Science Engineering 👨‍💻 at [UC Chile](https://www.uc.cl/en).

I'm very passionate about computer science, cybersecurity and using tech for social impact. I do a lot of interdisciplinary work, spanning everything from edtech to metascience, and I've also been involved in public policy, campaigning and consultancy.

I'm the Digital Platforms Lead at [América Transparente](https://americatransparente.org/), an NGO working on enabling government transparency throughout Latin America by building open source tools for journalists. I've also been an organizer of [March for Science](https://marchforscience.org/) Chile since 2017, working to push for better scientific policy in Chile.

I co-founded the [Assembly for Knowledge and Research](https://acic.cl) and [Open Source UC](https://osuc.dev/).

💬 Feel free to contact me if you're looking to collaborate on something!

My pronouns are he/him.
