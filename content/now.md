<summary>What is this page?</summary>
<p>This page is a list of the things I'm currently doing, following the format laid out by the <a href="https://nownownow.com/about"><code>/now</code></a> movement.</p>
<p>This page has a dual purpose:</p>
<ul>
    <li>It helps you know what I'm up to (if you're so inclined)</li>
    <li>It helps me be aware of all the stuff I'm doing, so I can learn to say no 😶‍🌫️</li>

## 📚 Studying engineering

I'm currently studying Computer Science Engineering at [UC Chile](https://uc.cl/en).

My ~~current~~ just finished course workload is:

- Topics in Strategic Analysis (ICP0323)
- Software Engineering (IIC2143)
- Databases (IIC2413)
- Introduction to Economics (ICS1513)

## 🏛️ América Transparente

I'm working pro bono as the Digital Platforms lead for [América Transparente](https://www.americatransparente.org). I'm currently trying to unifying the infrastructure behind two of our platforms, [Reguleque](https://reguleque.cl) and [Dueños Directos](https://dd.americatransparente.org) to cut some costs and make it all more maintainable.

👉 I'll be speaking about my work in the foundation in a short talk at [JuliaCon 2022](https://juliacon.org/2022/), coming july 27th.

## 🚀 EDAE

I'm currently working as the co-coordinator of the Telemetry, Tracking and Control team of [EDAE](https://github.com/EDAE-Chile/), a model rocketry initiative at UC Chile.

So far we're just getting started, so we've organized a couple workshops on C and C++, and I'm currently preparing an Embedded Rust workshop.

## 👾 Open Source UC

I'm lending a hand in restructuring the community behind [Open Source UC](https://osuc.dev/). We're trying to get more people actively involved, and we think we need to make significant changes in governance and identity for that to happen.

## 💡 Proposals

I'm currently working in two proposals for [UC's School of Engineering](https://ing.puc.cl/en/), as part of my work for the [Academic Councillor's office](https://www.instagram.com/consejeria_inguc/):

- 🙌 **Ethics in Engineering:** We're trying to help shape our own ethics across the curriculum program by linking it with lessons learned in [Mozilla's Responsible Computing Science Challenge](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/what-we-fund/awards/responsible-computer-science-challenge/), as well as similar [initiatives at Stanford](https://cs4good.com/). We're still discussing the initial details of such a proposal.

- 📈 **Building a new planner:** We made a [proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IxAJ8cCzDkayPwnju5kgc2oKc7g9fvwf/view?usp=sharing) to renew the School's planner application by replacing it with a platform made by students for students, inspired by Princeton's [TigerPath](https://www.tigerpath.io/). It got initial approval, and we're just waiting to get started.

## 🤚 Altruismo Efectivo UC

I'm helping to set up an [Effective Altruism](https://effectivealtruism.org/) chapter at UC Chile; we are now participating in some extremely cool workshops for university chapters and organizing some talks for the near future.

## 🚆 Random stuff

- 👨‍💻 I'm helping build a website for the university political movement I participate in, [Nueva Acción Universitaria (NAU)](https://naupuc.cl/).
- 🔐 I'm trying to create a Rust re-implementation of [Cryptomator's](https://cryptomator.org/) [cryptolib](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptolib). It's proving way harder than I expected.
