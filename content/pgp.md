+++

If you want to communicate with me securely, you should start by publicly auditing my identity and its associated key through my [Keybase profile](https://keybase.io/agucova). You can send me secure messages using the [Keybase app](https://keybase.io/agucova/chat/), or by sending me an encrypted email using the [OpenPGP](https://protonmail.com/blog/what-is-pgp-encryption/) protocol to [agustin@agucova.dev](mailto:agustin@agucova.dev). If your email client doesn't support it, you can find a suitable client or addon [here](https://www.openpgp.org/software/).
